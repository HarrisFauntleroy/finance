The formula for the future value with periodic compounding is:

FV = PV \* (1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:

- FV is the future value
- PV is the present value (the initial amount of money)
- r is the annual interest rate
- n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year
- t is the number of years the money is invested for

To prove this formula, we can use the definition of compound interest: the interest earned on the initial investment plus the interest earned on any previous interest.

If we have an initial investment of PV dollars, and we earn r percent interest per year, compounded n times per year, then after one year, the total value of our investment will be:

FV = PV \* (1 + r/n)^n

Notice that the exponent of (1 + r/n) is n, which is the number of times per year that the interest is compounded. This means that the interest is compounded n times in the first year.

If we want to find the future value after t years, then we can simply repeat this process t times:

FV = PV \* (1 + r/n)^(n \* t)

This is the formula for the future value with periodic compounding.

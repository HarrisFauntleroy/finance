Using Turborepo with GitHub Actions
The following example shows how to use Turborepo with GitHub Actions(opens in a new tab).

For a given root package.json:

{
  "name": "my-turborepo",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "turbo run build",
    "test": "turbo run test"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "turbo": "1.2.5"
  }
}

And a turbo.json:

{
  "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "outputs": [".next/**", "!.next/cache/**"],
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    },
    "test": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    }
  },
}

Create file called .github/workflows/ci.yml in your repository with the following contents:

name: CI
 
on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
 
jobs:
  build:
      name: Build and Test
      timeout-minutes: 15
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest

      steps:
        - name: Check out code
          uses: actions/checkout@v3
          with:
            fetch-depth: 2
 
        - name: Setup Node.js environment
          uses: actions/setup-node@v3
          with:
            node-version: 16
            cache: 'yarn'
 
        - name: Install dependencies
          run: yarn
 
        - name: Build
          run: yarn build
 
        - name: Test
          run: yarn test

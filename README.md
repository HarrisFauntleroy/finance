   security features, and a test coverage suite of 100%.

   This phase involves introducing bank APIs to automate transaction and balance
   tracking, with the initial focus on integrating the Up Bank API.

   In this phase, selected cryptocurrencies will be integrated, with features
   for crypto wallet integration and automated transaction and balance tracking.

4. **Phase 4: Budgeting Tools**  
   The fourth phase will see the development of budget management features,
   including budget creation and management, expense tracking against the set
   budget, and visual representation of budgets using graphs, pie-charts, etc.

5. **Phase 5: Market Analysis**  
   Lastly, market analysis features will be incorporated, including integration
   of market data feeds, development of market analysis tools for trends and

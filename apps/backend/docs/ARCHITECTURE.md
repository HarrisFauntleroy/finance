# Architecture Description

## Overview

This Kotlin project follows a modular and layered architecture, aiming to
separate concerns and make the codebase scalable, maintainable, and testable.
The main components include API, configurations, domain logic, external
dependencies, jobs, models, repositories, security, services, and utility
classes.

## Project Structure

### Application.kt

The entry point of the application, responsible for bootstrapping and
initializing core components.

### api

- **helpers**: Contains utility functions and classes to assist API
  functionalities.
- **local**: Manages local APIs for debugging and internal usage.
- **model**: Data structures used for API requests and responses.

### configurations

Holds all the configuration settings, including environment-specific configs.

### domain

Contains business logic and domain-specific algorithms.

### external

Manages external services and third-party libraries.

### jobs

Handles long-running and scheduled tasks.

### models

Defines data models, entities, and DTOs (Data Transfer Objects).

### repositories

Abstraction layer between domain logic and data sources.

### security

Implements authentication and authorization features.

### services

Contains services that hold business logic and depend on repositories for data
operations.

### utils

A collection of utility functions and classes that are reused across the
project.

## Feature Lifecycle

1. **Consideration**: New features are discussed and considered based on their
   impact, priority, and complexity.
2. **Planning**: A design document is created, specifying the architectural
   changes, affected modules, and timeline.
3. **Implementation**: Features are developed in isolated branches, adhering to
   the project's coding guidelines.
4. **Testing**: Unit and integration tests are written to validate the feature.
5. **Code Review**: Code is reviewed by peers for maintainability and adherence
   to coding standards.
6. **Deployment**: After successful reviews and testing, the feature is deployed
   to a staging environment for further testing.
7. **Monitoring**: Post-deployment, the feature is monitored for performance and
   errors.
8. **Release**: If all checks pass, the feature is merged into the main branch
   and released.

## Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Written for individual components, often residing in the same
  package but under a `/test` directory.
- **Integration Tests**: Cover the interaction between modules and services,
  ensuring the system works cohesively.
- **E2E Tests**: Simulate real-world scenarios to validate the entire flow of
  the application.

New features must pass all these test categories before being considered for a
release. Automated CI/CD pipelines are in place to enforce this criterion.

By adhering to this architecture, the project aims to be a robust, scalable, and
maintainable codebase.
